            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p> Game play,
            - Must have 2 players
            - Must have 3 rounds - 3 rounds make up 1 game
            - Each player starts with a score of 0 and alternates turns responding to the current survey
            - Each player's score should be displayed by their name
            - In the first two rounds, players will take turns guessing responses to the survey. The round is over when all
            responses to the survey have been guessed
            - The third round should be a "Fast Money" round: each player gets 30 seconds to enter as many responses as they can
            think of
            - The winner is determined by the player with the highest total score at the end of 3 rounds
          Survey,
          - A single, random survey should be chosen at the start of every round
          - The survey chosen at the start of each round should not be shown more than once in a game
          - Each survey includes a question and the top 3 responses
          - Each response has a number associated with it that represents the number of people who gave that response
          - Initially, only the survey question should be displayed and all responses should be hidden.
          - As a player guesses a response, the survey should check its responses for a match
          - If there is a match, that answer should be revealed along with the number of respondents who gave it
          - If there is no match, the UI should indicate that answer is not on the board
          - Responses should be displayed on the board in the order of most popular to least popular
        As a player,
        - I should be able to quit/start a new game at any time
        - I should be able to input a guess
        - If I guess a correct response, I am awarded points. My score should increment by the number of people who also
        responded with my guess.
        - If I guess an incorrect response, I am not awarded points. My score will not increment, and it will then be the other
        player's turn.
        - In the fast money round, I will multiply my awarded points for that round by that number (e.g. if I correctly guess 2 responses
        that were worth a combined 70 points, and I entered a multiplier of 2, I would be awarded 140 points for that round)</p>
